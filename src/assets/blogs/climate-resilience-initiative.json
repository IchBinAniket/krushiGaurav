At Aikya Seva Centre, we’re building climate resilience by empowering farmers and villagers with sustainable water, agriculture, and livelihood practices.</p>\n\n<h2>Community-led Water Management</h2>\n<p>From check dams to recharge pits, our watershed interventions are helping replenish local aquifers. These efforts not only improve farming but reduce migration in drought seasons.</p>\n<img src=\"assets/images/watershed/shitavPanoli.jpg\" alt=\"Check dam in Panoli\" />\n\n<h2>Agroecology for Sustainable Farming</h2>\n<p>We’ve trained 200+ farmers in organic techniques like composting, drip irrigation, and mixed cropping. These climate-smart practices reduce dependency on chemical inputs and improve yields.</p>\n<img src=\"assets/images/farmers/2.jpg\" alt=\"Farmers using vermicompost beds\" />\n\n<h2>Women in Climate Action</h2>\n<p>Women-led self-help groups are now taking charge of water budgeting and tree plantation drives. Empowering women helps scale climate action across families and communities.</p>\n<img src=\"assets/images/women/3.jpg\" alt=\"Tree plantation by women's SHG\" />\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Resilience isn't just about infrastructure — it's about ownership, knowledge, and dignity. Through local leadership and participatory planning, we’re ensuring that climate solutions are not just top-down, but bottom-up and lasting.</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p style=\"font-size: 0.9rem; color: gray;\">Author: <strong>Jindo</strong></p>"
